**Description:** Analyzed the Honey Production in the USA dataset to visualize trends in honey production from 1998 to 2021. Explored the impact of honeybee population decline on American honey agriculture.<BR>
<BR>
**Data Source:** Honey Production in USA dataset<BR>
<BR>
1)Visualize changes in honey production over time.<BR>
2)Identify production trends across states.<BR>
3)Analyze trends in honey-producing colonies and yield per colony.<BR>
4)Investigate the relationship between total honey production and production value.<BR>
5)Examine changes in production value over the years.<BR>
6)Fluctuations in honey production over the years.<BR>
7)Significant production trends in states like California and North Dakota.<BR>
8)Decline in the number of honey-producing colonies before 2006.<BR>
<BR>
**Visualization:**  Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization and customization.<BR>
<BR>
Technologies Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn<BR>
