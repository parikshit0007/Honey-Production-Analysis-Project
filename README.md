# Honey-Production-Analysis-Project
Analyzed the Honey Production in the USA dataset to visualize trends in honey production from 1998 to 2021. Explored the impact of honeybee population decline on American honey agriculture.

**Honey Production Analysis**

**Description:** Analyzed the Honey Production in the USA dataset to visualize trends in honey production from 1998 to 2021. Explored the impact of honeybee population decline on American honey agriculture.

**Data Source:** Honey Production in USA dataset


1)Visualize changes in honey production over time.
2)Identify production trends across states.
3)Analyze trends in honey-producing colonies and yield per colony.
4)Investigate the relationship between total honey production and production value.
5)Examine changes in production value over the years.
6)Fluctuations in honey production over the years.
7)Significant production trends in states like California and North Dakota.
8)Decline in the number of honey-producing colonies before 2006.

**Visualization:**  Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization and customization.

Technologies Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
